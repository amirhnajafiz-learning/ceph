Important and most used terminal commands that I use every day. I call them ```do-scripts``` since
they are shell scripts in ```.do``` directory.

## install

In order to install these scripts on your system, use the ```install.sh``` script.
This script will export repository scripts under ```.do``` directory in your system.
File structure is as follow:

```shell
|_.do/
  |_vpn/
    |_forti/
      |_...
    |_v2ray/
      |_...
  |_openshift/
    |_...
  |_...
```
